# UGUIExperiment
Basic demonstration of Unity's UI feature.

This was made with Unity 2017.3.0f3.

The project's Unity version is now 2018.2.11f1.

### What is covered

- Most (if not all) UGUI components.
- Usage of overlay and world space canvas.
- Canvas ordering.
- Adding listeners from inspector and from code.
- Event system, event triggers and physics raycaster with event system interfaces use.
- Probably some more stuff.

### Teachings of scene OverlayUI

- GameObject hierarchy and mandatory components (Canvas and RectTransforms).
- UGUI secondary components (Raycaster, EventSystem).
- UGUI optional components (controls, layouts, fills, scroll area).
- "World Space" canvas render mode.
- Responsivity (how to support multiple resolutions).
- Error prone VS robust event binding.

### Teachings of scene Ordering

- Sort order.
- More layouts examples.
- Image fill example.

### Teachings of scene InGameUI

- "World Space" canvas render mode example.
- Still more layout examples.
- Event Trigger component.

### Teachings of scene Events

- Event interfaces (don't forget that EventSystem).

### InGameUI instructions

- WASD or arrows to move.
- Mouse to look around.
- Hold down right Ctrl button to "unlock" mouse cursor.
- While mouse cursor is unlocked, you may press on the buttons in the world space UI made to look like a monitor on the wall.
- Pressing "Porte" will  make the green energy field disappear (or reappear).
- Pressing "Lumière" will turn OFF/ON the lights.
- Pressing "Éteindre" will shut down the wall display permanently.
